# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## 📝 Objective  
Implement and evaluate the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify animal types based on the provided dataset.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
- Classification Goal: **Classify animal types**  
- Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values and outliers.

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed  

### 1. Data Analysis  
- Visualized the dataset to understand patterns and relationships.

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- Addressed missing values and handled any detected outliers.  

### 3. Data Splitting  
- Divided the dataset into:
  - **Training set**: 80% of the data  
  - **Testing set**: 20% of the data  

### 4. KNN Implementation  
- Used the **scikit-learn** library to implement KNN.  
- Experimented with:  
  - Various `K` values.  
  - Different distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).  

### 5. Model Evaluation  
- Evaluated the model with the following metrics:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-score  

### 6. Decision Boundary Visualization  
- Plotted decision boundaries to visualize KNN classification behavior.

## 🔑 Key Concepts  

### Hyperparameters in KNN  
- Number of neighbors (`K`).  
- Choice of distance metric.  

### Distance Metrics  
1. **Euclidean Distance**: Direct distance between two points.  
2. **Manhattan Distance**: Sum of absolute differences of coordinates.  
3. **Minkowski Distance**: Generalized form of the above two.
